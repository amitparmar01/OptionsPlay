			There can be significant risk of losses in trading securities and options. Customers must consider all relevant risk elements including their individual financial circumstances prior to trading. Options involve risks and are not suitable for every investor. Prior to buying or selling an option, an investor must receive a copy of Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options. Also, please note on December 17, 2009 the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") approved a <span class="underline">Supplement to the Options Disclosure Document ("ODD")</span> providing information relating to options on indexes and the adjustment of stock option contracts. Any results posted are unique and are not indicative of any future results.

		<p>
			Copies may be obtained from your broker, one of the exchanges or the Options Clearing Corporation. Historical results do not indicate future performance. OptionsPlay does not guarantee in writing or verbally that material on this website or that taught in the videos or written material contained in the associated files that accompany the videos will result in a profit. Investors need a broker to trade options, and must meet suitability requirements.

			For ease of simplicity, all examples used on this website and in the videos exclude commissions, interest and dividend and other transaction fees, tax considerations, or margin requirements, which are factors that may significantly affect the economic consequences of trades illustrated. Please contact a tax advisor for the tax implications involved with trading specific spread types and read the Options Disclosure Document (ODD) prior to investing in options. You can obtain a copy of the ODD at <a href="http://www.theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp" target="_blank">http://www.theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp</a>; or, from the Options Clearing Corporation (1888-options), One North Wacker Drive, Suite 500, Chicago IL 60606.
